    strong Important security information:
  
  ul
    li This password reset link will expire in #{expirationTime}
    li The link can only be used once
    li If you don't reset your password within this time, you'll need to request a new reset link
  
  h2 Didn't Request This?

  h2 Alternative Method
  
  p
    | If the button above doesn't work, you can copy and paste the following link into your browser:
  
  p.text-muted(style="word-break: break-all; font-family: monospace; background-color: #f3f4f6; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px;")
    = resetUrl
  
  p.text-muted
    | For security reasons, this link will expire in #{expirationTime}.
  
  p.text-muted
    | Best regards,
    br
